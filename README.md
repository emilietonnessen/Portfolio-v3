# Portfolio 3.0

This is my portfolio, made to showcase my work, personality and talents.

## Technologies

- React JS
- TypeScript
- Sass
- Framer Motion
- Sanity

## TODO

- [ ] Apply everything I learned from the "Universal design for websites" to the design and code
  - Design and apply focus styling as the default is different on each operating system and browser so I can't rely on that working with my color palette.
  - Go over all images and make sure all alt texts are up to date
  - Check color contrast

## Credits

The design and how I worked with Sanity and Framer Motion was inspired from a tutorial made by "JavaScript Mastery" on YouTube
